    1.Understand about child labours
    The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines child labour as work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular schools, and is mentally, physically, socially, or morally harmful.
B. Global prevalence: Despite international efforts, approximately 152 million children worldwide are involved in child labour, with nearly half engaged in hazardous work

2.causes of child labour

a)Lack of education, illiteracy and consequently the lack of awareness of their rights among them have encouraged child labour.

b)Cultural and social attitudes: Societal norms and cultural traditions may normalize child labor. In some communities, it is considered acceptable for children to work at an early age, often in agriculture, domestic work, or informal sectors. These attitudes can perpetuate the cycle of child labor across generations</p>
